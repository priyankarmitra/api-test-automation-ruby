Feature: Find the cities and streets for a given postcode
  AS a Verivox developer
  I WANT TO find city and street names for a particular German postcode
  SO THAT I can help customers select their address details more easily

  @automated @scenario1
  Scenario Outline: Find the cities for a given postcode
    Given the address checking service endpoint: "<Endpoint>"
    When I request the cities for postcode "<Postcode>"
    Then I should receive a response with "<CityList>"
    And No JSON data is returned for HTTP error status
    And The response <HttpStatus> status code should match

    Examples:
